(*)when to use this? when you want to showsome information only when the user clicks
on a botton for example , for ex if the user should click for a button
on a menuitem to show its ingreients or something

(*)like when we can return a View in te Controller , you can also
return PartialView , but why??
--> we make this for the asynchronous request made from the browser
-->from the browser you can make asynchronous request using JavaScript Code
either by using 1-XML http request , 2-fetch api in javascript

(*) so when the controller recieves the asynchronous request  , creates a model
object , pass this mode object to the partial view , then partial view
executes in the server side 

(*)partial view can contain both c# code and html code
-->1-C# code will be executed in server side
-->2-html code will be returned as response to the browser
-->the executed content of the partial view will be added to the response body



ulinke the original action methods , we invoke this action method that returns
the PartialViewResult through javascript code asynchronously
