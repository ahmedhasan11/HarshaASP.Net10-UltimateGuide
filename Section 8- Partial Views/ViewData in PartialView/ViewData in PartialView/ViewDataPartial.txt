(*)when you invoke the partial view in yout View , a "copy" of the existing data object
will be supplied to the partial view

(*) if your View Data oject have 5 items , at runtime a copy of these 5 items will be 
supplied to the partial view

(*) so then you can access these data usingViewData in your Partial View

(**) most important note: as we saidwejust supply a "Copy" so anychange you will do in the
ViewData in the partial view will not affect the data in the View
