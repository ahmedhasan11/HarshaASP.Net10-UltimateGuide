MapGroups-->meaning grouping your endpoints based on a particular route prefix

-->instead you write multiple endpoints that have the common prefix independently
you can group them together so that you will be having the chance of separating
the same into a separate file instead of writing too much code inprogram.cs file

--.also you can apply the authorizationpolicies or filters easily for all of them

-->so instead of--> app.MapGet("/products",async (HttpContext context) =>
{
	var content = string.Join("\n", products.Select(product => product.ToString()));
	await context.Response.WriteAsync(content);
});

you can do this -->
var mapgroup= app.MapGroup("/products");

//GET Products -->Minimal API
mapgroup.MapGet("/",async (HttpContext context) =>
{
	var content = string.Join("\n", products.Select(product => product.ToString()));
	await context.Response.WriteAsync(content);
});
