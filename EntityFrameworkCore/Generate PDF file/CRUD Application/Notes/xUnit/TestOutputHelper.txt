//what is the TestOutputHelper?

in yourtest cases look at the results if the test passed-->nothing is shown just test passed

//what if we want the results we did to show , if we addeed some persons and we want after test passed
in the text box below it shows the expected values and actual values so we can make sure everything is okay

how?
1-inject the testoutputhelper service in your PersonTest class using the ItestOutputHelper interface

2-use the _testoutputhelper.WriteLine("put here the message you want to show that define the details", object you will read from)

3-in("put here the message you want to show that define the details", object.ToString()) we added the .ToString()

4-go to the PersonResponse(the class that we read from its object)--> and override the .ToString() method

5-after overriding you haveto printthe value of each property you want to show

6-in your test class print the actual value and expected
