(*)PROBLEM-->we talked about doing search , now we are going to create sort-->we need when we click on the table header
link Person Name -->elements be sorted based on Person Name Decs-->because its already sorted Ascendent
-->also when we clickon the Person Name again-->it should returns to the normal Ascendent Order

(*) we want to do all of that for all headers and also there is an icon from the fontawesome app that reresenets if 
tghe sort now on the column asc or decs , its just an arrow that is either up or down , you can use it inside <i> tag
just use the specific style used for it

What We have to do??
1- you have to get the value the user did like we did in search when wegot the SearchBy& SearchString
you also have SortBy& SortOrder-->so get them also from the QueryString ,--> and put them into the params into Index action
-->then create for them initial value which SortBy=PersonName&SortOrder=ASC so each time you open the View datais ordered
based on the PersonName Header-->then Create ViewBag for them to access them to check the CurrentValue so you can make your conditions

2-you have 3 Conditions for each header -->(1)ASC-->DESC , (2)DESC-->ASC, (3)Normal One(so there is no arrow)
-->by default 3 conditions for every header is too much code , so here we will use PartialView and it checks for the
Specified nameof(PersonResponse.Property)-->we will pass the ColumnName & DisplayName from the IndexView -->to PartialView
while calling the Html.PartialAsync() by each time you are creating a new obj of ViewDataDictionary(ViewData) this is a
dictionary that we can access its Key& Value Pairs in our PartialView

3-so foreach header--> you will call the Html.PartialAsync() and pass to it (1) the name of the partialview &(2)the new obj of the
ViewDataDictionary(ViewData) and pass the data we need whichis the ColumnName andDisplayName and use these keys in our
PartialView so now the PartialView is Dynamic
