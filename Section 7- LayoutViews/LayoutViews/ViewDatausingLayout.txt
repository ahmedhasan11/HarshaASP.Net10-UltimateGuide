if you made a ViewData in your controller -->we said you can access it in your View

but you can also access it in the Layout View

//remember when we got confused about what is ViewData["Title"]=""; in every view
when you let the razor make it by himself?? that is a ViewData we did in out View
so that we can access it in the Layout View to make the name of each tab
of our application or the name of each view in the browser is the ViewData["Title"]="name";

//go to layout and in headers put 
<title> @ViewData["Title"]</title> so that whne layout being processed in each view
,the layout access the ViewData["Title"] of that specific View and put the value
of the ViewData["Title"] is the name of the tab in the browser
