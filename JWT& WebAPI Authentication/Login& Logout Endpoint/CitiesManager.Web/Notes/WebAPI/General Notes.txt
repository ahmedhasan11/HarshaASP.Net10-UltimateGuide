(*)which controller youwill create? 
1-the empty one youwill writemethodswhateveryou want
2-api controller with action using EF-->all action methodswith all HTTP methods to create,update,delete,.... on a specific table

(*)its a must that your controller contain attribute routing with [ApiController]

(*)in case of WebAPI you will apply attribute routing for the Controller only not for every action method
-->the action method will be auto selected by asp.net core itself dependingon HTTP method that is used for request
-->so if you made a get Requestto CitiesController it goes through Cities Controller and searches for the aciton method
that have the [HTTPGet] ,,,the action method name doesn't matter
