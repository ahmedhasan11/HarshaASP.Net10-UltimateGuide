Q1:how to make a stored procedure using EF Core??
ANS:you can do it inside the migration file , so you can add-mnigration , and in the up method of this migration-->you can write the proc

string sp_GetAllPersons= @ "CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[GetAllPersons]
							AS BEGIN
							//write your sql statement here
							SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Persons]
							END"

then look at the parameter which is in the up method , there is migrationbuilder object

migrationbuilder.sql(sp_GetAllPersons)


//when this proc will be implemented at your db? when you call the update-database


(*)dont forget  to copy the code of the procedure and put it in the down method , because at anytme you would like to rollback 
-->but instead of CREATE-->DROP


Q2:where& how to call this sp ?
ANS: create a method in your DbContext class , this method will be used to call this sp , so in your services
you can call _db.MethodName
