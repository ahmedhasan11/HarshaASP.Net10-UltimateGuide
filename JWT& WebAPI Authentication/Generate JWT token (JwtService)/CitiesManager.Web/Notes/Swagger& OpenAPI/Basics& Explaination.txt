-->the specification that helps the developers to write web API specification in JSON format
-->by using that JSON some tools such as Swagger or Nslog can understand the structure of web API service 
-->can understand what request details are to be sent to service and what is the response structure 
-->then accordingly they can generate the client side code

so in brief-->by using Swagger you can generate the user interface that is used to test the web API
