Problem: wesaidthat token havetime for expiraton , assume thattoken is expired
after 10 min , what happens now, user have to login again to get anewtoken , imagine that user
re-login every 10 min 

Solution-->Refresh Token(automatic regenration of the JWT token)

RefreshToken: isnot thesame as JWT token it doesn't contain header,payload,etc..
,its just a base64 string of a random number

Flow:
1-user sign in
2-server create-->1-JWT Token , 2-Refresh Token
3- as soonas the JWTexpires,the browser makesanother requesttoanendpoint in the 
APIserver , heyapi server take  this refreshtoken and ifthistoken is valid,
please regenratea newJWt token for me

4-API server verifies both tokens, the ExpiredJWt& RefreshToken
-->it generates a  new JWT token

so -->in this way refresh token is a proof of user authenticity indicating that
the userisvaliduser

//don't forget-->when harsha tested all these , hesupplied the refreshtoken& jwttoken in angular
