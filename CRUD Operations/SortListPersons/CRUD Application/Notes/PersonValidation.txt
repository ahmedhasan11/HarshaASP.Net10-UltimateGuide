(*)if you have too many properties , and you have to do multiple validations for each one, here if statments arenot
good because of the lengthy code , instead , check for the model that you will validate 
//which here is the PersonAddRequest , then usedata anootaions attributes, but we have to 
call thesedata anootations programatically in the service
//we have to programmatically call the model validations related methods which are part of componentmodel.dataannotations
//so go the model you want to validate andput your data annotation attributes
//then go validate the same modelin the Service

//1-we put the attributes in the personaddrequest
//2- we have to create obj of the ValidationContext Class because the model validations can occur
under a context-->it contains the ref to the model which have to be validated

//3-create obj of List<ValidationResult> to store the validation errors 

//4-Validator.TryValidateObject(model, contextobj, validationresutlobj, true)

-->true--> is for validate all model properties 
(*)(if you suppliued false or you let it empty)-->it only validate the required 

(*)but we need to do these validationsona dd person & update person , repeatingsame code
isnot good , so make it as a individual class and call it whereever you need
