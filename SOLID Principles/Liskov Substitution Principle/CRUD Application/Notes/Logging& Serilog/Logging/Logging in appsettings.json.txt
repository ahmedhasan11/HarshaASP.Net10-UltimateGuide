try to testsome logs, try them all  in your program.cs and run
-->look at the cmd that kestrel made , ohhhh debug didnt show
-->but why? because by default internally its set as the lowest level is information

-->so if the lowset level is information , whatever low than it wil not be shown

-->Default:Information (will show 2-5), -->Default:Warning(will show 3-5)

1-Debug            2-Information          3-Warning       4-Error     5-Critical

-->so to show debug , you can find the "Default" in appsettings.json in "Logging" , write "Debug"
-->"Microsoft.AspNetCore":"Warning" -->this represents the logs from the predefined library
of EF core , let it as it is

-->PROBLEM 
what is it?Debug will not be shown also, WHY?
-->because logs are being overwritten by appsettings.development.json because its being run and loaded
after the appsettings.json, 

SOLUTION-->make the default in appsettings.development.json  -->Debug also
