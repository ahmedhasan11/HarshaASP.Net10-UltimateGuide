Mandatory on Real-world projects you have to enable it
-->we use it in production errors or Staging errors
when an exception happens in any middleware or filters or action methods
-->Development-->shows Developer Exception Page
-->Production-->HTTP 500

Exception Filter -->scope is vsery limited just for action method& action filter

but exceptions can occur anyway for ex: executing any other middleware, you can 
have 10 middlewares chained together , in order to catch any exception,
we need a superior mechanism to catch exceptions that happens anywhere

Exception Filter-->catch exceptions of action filter selection method execution

Exception Handling Middleware-->to handle exceptions of all the middleware including
action methods and action filters and all other filters like (Global Exception Handler)
