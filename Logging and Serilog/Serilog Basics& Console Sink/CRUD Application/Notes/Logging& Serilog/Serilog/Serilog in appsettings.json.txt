we have to configure the serilog in our appsettings.json 
-->must be "Serilog" then only the serilog package can identify the configuration
-->remember when you gave the Serilog permission to read form our appsettings.json??????
 that's whaappening here Serilog auto read from our appsettings.json 

 -->that's why we must made it "Serilog"

 -->what should we mention inside the configuration of "Serilog"

 1-"Using"-->List of sinks --> "Serilog.Sinks.Console"
 2-"MinimumLevel" -->minimum log level like when we said Information or debug ,etc.......
 3-"WriteTo" -->configure additional settings of each individual sink
 "WriteTo":[{"Name":"Console"}]

 the 3 is a MUST , 

 in brief -->when you want to add a sink into the serilog configuratiuon
 -->you jhave toadd it into "Using" and "WriteTo"
