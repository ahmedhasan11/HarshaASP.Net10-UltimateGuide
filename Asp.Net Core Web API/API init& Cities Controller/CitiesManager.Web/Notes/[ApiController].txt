-->specifies that these action methods are going to be APi action metohds 
not regular mvc controller actoion methods or endpoints 
so they will not render any view whatever happened

-->also enforeces the controller must to have attribute routing([Route("")])
-->automatically returns bad request result in case any bad request found inthe model state
,,so you dont have to make a condition that if model state
is invalid so return bad request it is auto done using this[ApiController]
