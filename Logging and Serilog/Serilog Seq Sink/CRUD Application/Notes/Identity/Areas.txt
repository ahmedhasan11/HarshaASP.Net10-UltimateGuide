#Code:how toredirect actin to a specific Area?
	what we will do here? in the Login post -->_usermanager.IsInRoleAsync(user, ApplicationRoleEnum.Admin.ToString())-->you are checking
	if this user is Admin using the IsInRoleAsync() method  -->if he is Admin ,we want to redirect him tothe action method which
	isin the Home Controller of the Admin Area but how do we do this????
	Answer--> pass the name of the area as anonymous obj-->return RedirectToAction("Index","Home", new {area = "Admin"})

#EndCode

#Careful!!!!!!!!

if youareinthe layout.cshtml andyou are doing a hyper link to an action thatis in Admin area
, thenyou have to mention the asp-areapropertyinsidethe <a>tag
-->like this <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index" asp-area="Admin"> , if you didnt mention the asp-area , it will try to search 
on the controller of the root level



also-->if you are in area's Views and you are creating a hyperlink , by default it will search on admin area , 
Solve--> use asp-area="", let it empty that's it!


if you are in admin area-->compiler search on admin area


if you areinroot-->compiler search on root
