There is a scope for Filters
(1)-->action method filter-->[TypeFilter] is on action method 

(2)-->class filter -->[TypeFilter] is on the class (filter applied to all action
methods that are in that class) 

(3)-->Global Filters-->Filter is  at the root level on program.cs , so filter
getting applied at all controllers on all their action methods

                                [Global Filters]
-->in builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews(),, inside this parameter
you have to make a lambda expression, then we have to add our filter class 

-->2 syntax for adding filter class 
(1--> options.Filters.Add<FilterClassName>()); -->you can't supply parameters
(2--> options.Filters.Add(new FilterClassName())); -->you can supply parameters
