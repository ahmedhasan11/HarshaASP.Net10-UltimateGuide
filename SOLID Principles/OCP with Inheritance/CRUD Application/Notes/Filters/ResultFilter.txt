-->like the before and after the action -->ActionResult 
--> before and after Result -->ResultFilter

when you return a view in action method 
Flow--> 
OnActionExecuted --> if(any exception)-->ExceptionFilter

since the ViewResult is returned from the action method
-->the view will execute -->all razor code blocks of the 
view 

						[Why to use it]
1-OnResultExecuting() -->you can short Circuit the execution
of the result, you can return some other result other than what 
was actually returned in the action method

ex:there is Create GET , returns ViewResult,,but for some
reason you dont want to give the ViewResult for the Create View
,instead you would like to give content result to the browser

so-->you successfully returned a view from action method but
it have been short circuited from the ResultFilter

(*)you can also add additional ViewData before the view executes

2-OnResultExecuted -->here the result is already executed
so here you can change any something in the response body or headers


its is rare to use in real world projects
