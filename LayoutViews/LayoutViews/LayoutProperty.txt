in each View you have a Property called Layout

it specifies the Layout you want to use to your View

//notice that you should modify this Property only when you need to print
a specific layout view to that specific View

//but if you have some views that will have the same layout so you dont need
to repeat this statment of 	Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml"; everytime this is 
not good 
, 

instead --> we add this statement once in the _ViewStart.cshtml
