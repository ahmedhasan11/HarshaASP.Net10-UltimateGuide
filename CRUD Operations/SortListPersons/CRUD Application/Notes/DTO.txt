DTO: data tansfer objects -->used for sending the request and receiveing the response
(these are not about browser request) , it mans the req between controller and service calss for example

what happens?
1- the controller sends a request ,
			sends the details in the form of request DTO object(CountryAddRequest)


2- the controller recieves an object of Response DTO (CountryResponse)

//these 2 objects are used for data exchange between controller and service

(*)DTO's used either 1- as argument to a method OR 2-response or return value from the method

Q1: how converting the Countryobj into a CountryResponse works with Extension Method?
Solution-->this extension method is going to be injected into the CountryModel class (it behaves like its added to Country class)
-->so you didnt change the code of the Country Model to make it as clean as possible
