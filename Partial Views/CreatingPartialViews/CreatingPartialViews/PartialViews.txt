assume there is a common content that has to be repeated multiple
places 

assume you have 10 views in dfferent places and you want exactly the same content

//so you can make this contentas a partial view

//it is recommended to putall your partial views in shared
//it is recommended to put all your partial views with _ prefix


//its like a function or method in programming you can callitanywhere

/////////How to invoke the partial view??????/ in your view
1-using taghelpers <partial name="nameof your partialview"></partial>
(returns content to parent view-->content of partial view will become content of parentview)

2-@await Html.PartialAsync("name of your partial view")
(returns content to parent view-->content of partial view will become content of parentview)

3-@await Html.RenderPartialAsync("name of your partial view") //here there is a problem
(stream content to browser-->content will be drectly streamed on the browser)
(so it improves the performance)
(returns void because it already streamed the content no need to return it to the view)

//to invoke it like this in 3 the prblem is this returns void so you should
invoke itinside code block
so the right way of the 3- step is--> 
@
{
@await Html.RenderPartialAsync("name of your partial view")
}
