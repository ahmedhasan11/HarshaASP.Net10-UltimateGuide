what is the return url???

imagine if now you aremaking a request to persons/create , but you didnt log in so you dont have
access , looatyour method we says that when youlog in it redirects you to persons/index-->but asa useryou 
will be confused

i made a request to createand in logged in , why you letme go to index???

there is a parameter the authorizationprovides in the query stringcalled ReturnUrl
it taesthe request theuserhave and store it in the query string you canseethis , but it will notwork
until you mae it work

-->useing model binding, inthe login GET--> you have to fetch the ReturnUrl using ModelBinding
, -->asp-route-ReturnUrl=@context.Request.Query["ReturnUrl"]

-->then get it in the POST Login using model binding, so get it inyour method , 

then you haveto make a if condition inside the success result

if(!string.isNullOrEmpty(ReturnUrl)&&Url.IsLocalUrl(ReturnUrl))
{
return LocalRedirect(ReturnUrl)
}

-->IsLocalUrl-->means is it in the same application
-->LocalRedirect-->use it security issue
