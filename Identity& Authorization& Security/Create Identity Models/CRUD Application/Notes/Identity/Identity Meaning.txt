remmeber when we was working only in applicationDbContext , wemake Dbset<Person>, DbSet<Country>

exactly similar to that in case of identity , Db sets are created based on these two entity classes
(IdentityUser<T>, IdentityRole<T>)


Packages: Install in Entities Class Library , also in the Web Project
1-Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
2-Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
