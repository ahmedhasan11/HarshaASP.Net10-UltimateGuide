most popular logging framwork in asp.net core
but why we use it?
-->because the intternal logging framework in asp net core doesn't support to log to other
external logged destination such as files or databases

-->sink: logging destination -->specifies where the logs should be stored
Console sink , Debug sink , EventLog sink , database sink , file sink , etc.....
