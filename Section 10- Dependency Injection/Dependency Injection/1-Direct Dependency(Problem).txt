here we only have 2 things

1-Controller

2-Service

##the problem here is the Controller is Fully Dependent on Service

how?

-->in controller constrcutor you have to do object from the service to use methods 

//what if you have 2 developers not only 1 

//developer a : responsible on developing controller
//developer b : responsible on developing Service

##theproblem--> developer A have towait until developer B complete the Service because you have to make an object
-->any changes in the service affect the controller
-->diff to test because they depend on each other
