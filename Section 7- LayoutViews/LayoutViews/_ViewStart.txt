the only purpose for _ViewStart.cshtml is to share a specific layout 

//1-can be used across all the Controllers --> put it just on the Views folder 
dont make it in shared or any other folder

//2-can be used local for a specific controller so it will use the specific layout
for only the views of the specific controller you make it inside

//dont use any data or access anydata as the same as _ViewImports

//the only purpose for _ViewStart is to share the layouts across all controller or
a specific controller
