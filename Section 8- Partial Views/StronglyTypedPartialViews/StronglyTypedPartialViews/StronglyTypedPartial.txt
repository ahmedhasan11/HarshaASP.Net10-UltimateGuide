(*) here we need to make the partial view as strong typed as we didin the normal View 
, so asbefore we should pass a model to the partial view to use it 

first of all , (*) you have to make a model calss with all properties that you want the partial view to access
//so for example we here are talking about 2properties which is ViewBag.ListTitle &&ViewBag.ListOfCountries
--> 1-so make a new model class with these 2 properties
--> 2-go to your view and open a code block
--> 3-inside code block make a object of the model class
--> 4-give some values to the object's properties 
--> 5-in partial tag helper give te tag helper the property model --><partial name="" model="name of model object you did"></partial>
-->5.1-you can use Html.RenderPartialAsync("name of partial view" , modelobject) instead of helper code
--> 6-go to your partial view and make the  @model model_Class_name 
--> 7-then as we said before you can access your properties with the Model property

,so thereis some questions

1-how can we pass the model to the partial view??
answer--> in your view , in the tag helper of partial <partial name=""></partial> you have a property called Model
can be typedlikethis <partial name="name of partial view" model="name of the model clss you will pass"></partial>
