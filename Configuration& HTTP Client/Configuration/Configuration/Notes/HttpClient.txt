Requirements: fetch some data from a webservice called finhub , and show the data



//there is a predefined HttpClient Service that youcan addto your services inprogram.cs

//then you can inject that service in that entir app

//theservice class name is HTTPClientFactory (not HTTPClient)

the interface IHTTPClientFactoryis implemented by apredefined class called DefaultHTTPFactory

IHTTPClientFactory-->Interface which is used  to create an instance of HTTPClient Class
(instead ofyoubyyourown create your instanceof the HTTPClient), but why?
the solution is-->1-afteryour responseis done andeverythingisdone, HTTPClientFactory take the 
responsibility to close the connection with the serverr

//we needtomake a request to another server , so we acts here as client
//steps to make arequest 
1-add HttpCLient service inprogram.cs
2-inject the Httpclient service using the IHTTPClientFactory(to use the benefitof the close connection)
,(also to makeit make an instance of the HTTPCLient insteadof we make it)

3- make a method to make our request

4-in that method use the using() , then now we needto tell the HttpClientFactory to make the instance
//do it using the obj.CreateCLient() -->obj here is the obj you injected

5-inside the using ,create an object of a class called HttpRequestMessage , in the brackets
of that object pass the URI and Http method , called RequestUri, Method

6-now using the obj injected youc an say obj.SendAsync(obj_ofRequestMessage), assign that into a
obj of HttpResponseMessage
