rememberthe UserStore & RoleStore that we were confused about it while adding the Identity as IOC service

both of them  calledthe repository layer of the Identity Architecture , so we had to configure
them thats all --> so you dont have to create your custom classes for the store

--> you can assume that the repository will be geneated automatically based on the datatypes you mentioned

1-it internally creates obj of DbContext through DI 
2-invokes the appropriate methods that is used to perform CRUD operations on the users table
(in brief repository accesses  the DbContext internally)
