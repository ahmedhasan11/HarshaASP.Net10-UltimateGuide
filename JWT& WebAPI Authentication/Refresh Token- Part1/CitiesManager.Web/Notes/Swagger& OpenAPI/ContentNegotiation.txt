(*) what is ContentNegotiation?
-->theinteractionbetween  client andserverabout the contentthat is present in the request body
and response body

//there issome problemns ,,, what is this???
Content Negotiation problem in webAPI is between browser and server
,,,,,lets take an example
when a beowser sendarequesttoserver
there issome several status
forexample:
1-browser send a request with request header content-type:application/json
,2- so now browser informs  theserver that the request body content-type is application/json
,3- also browser can specify what is the content-type of response that browser needs
,inrequest body, Accept:application/json , this informs the server ,be careful i
need the response in the application/json, so
-->now there is a problem-->watif the server needstoprovidethe response as application/xml
, so now server sends response as application/xml and it adds a response body, 
content-type:application/xml

and thats themain problemthatthere is conservatuon between server and browser

(*)by default in asp.netcore both request body&response body assumed as JSON info

(*)butthereissveral content-0typefor JSON,application/json, text/plain,text/json

but wehatif i needtoinformtheclient thatwewantto give the response onlyinthe formof
application/json

(*)how do we do that??????/
-->by a predefined filter called produces -->thisisfor response Body
(*)how to do the same for request body?
-->by a predefined filter called Consumes-->thisis for requestbody

-->both of themyoucanapply globallyby lambdaexpressionin the addControllers() service

builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
{
	options.Filters.Add(new ProducesAttribute("application/json"));
	options.Filters.Add(new ConsumesAttribute("application/json"));
});
