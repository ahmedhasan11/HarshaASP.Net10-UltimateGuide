Logging:is how to know that your app runs successfully without errors
-->even some errors are encountered how you track them
-->record all actions and errors that are occured in your app execution

assume:execution reached to action method , the log displays or stored the message
for later review purpose, if its reached to service , leave a message from service and so on...

Logging Framework : the intermediator between your app layer and Logs

Logs : data store where actual log messages are persisted so you can review it later

except console logs , all other logs can be reviewed later

1-ILogger.LogDebug("log message") -->debugging purpose (ex: current value of a var )

2-ILogger.LogInformation("log message")-->general flowof execution(ex: it reached controller )

3-ILogger.LogWarning("log message") -->app executed abnormally (ex: stuck into loop)

4-ILogger.LogError("log message")
5-ILogger.LogCritical("log message") -->dangerous exception leads to server crash or app crash
