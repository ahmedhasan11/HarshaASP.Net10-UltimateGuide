thereare 2 attributesinasp.net core to apply a filter for the particular action method
or Controller       1-TypeFilter      2-ServiceFilter

1-TypeFilter -->can supply arguments
2-ServiceFilter -->can't supply arguments



but whatever filter that you are putting inside this ServiceFilter
-->you have to add it as a aservice
ex: [ServiceFilter(typeof(PersonsListActionFilter))]
-->builder.Services.AddTransient<PersonsListActionFilter>();

as benefit-->both are same use whatever you like
