look at GetCity -->Task<ActionResult<>>
and look at PutCity-->Task<IActionResult>

but what is the difference why we sometimes use ActionResult and sometimes IActionResult
based on what???

In Asp.Net for all the Controllers-->fundamental return type is IActionResult
-->there is a lot of classes that are used like return types that implement this IActionResult
-->if you wouldlike to return thecontent on specific content type-->ContentResult
-->if you would like to return aspecificmodelobject asa return value-->ObjectResult
-->so if you want to return your things as a specific return type -->useIActionResult

buton theotherside of ActionResult
-->if you would like to return only ObjectResult from your code -->ActionResult
-->look atgetCities(),GetCity()-->both we used ActionResult becuase we are 
returning obj,,,if you want to use IActionResult here you haveto write the code to convert
this city object into any result type that we talked about like-->Ok(city)

look at PUT -->we wanted to return BadRequestResult&NotFoundResult&NoContextResult
,,so we used IActionResult


main thingof ObjectResult-->isto containmmodel obj-->convert it into JSON format
Different child classesofobjectResult:
1-OkObjectResult -->200 status code
2-CreatedAtActionResult-->201 statuscode
3-NotFoundObjectResult-->404 status code
4-BadRequestObjectResult-->400 status code
