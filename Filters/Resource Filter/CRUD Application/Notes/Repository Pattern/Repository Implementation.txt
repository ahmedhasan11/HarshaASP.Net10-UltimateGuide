the main difference between Repository and Service
--> Repository is the pure implementation of the data access logic
--> means it's tightly coupled to the domain
-->we can access the Dbcontext and Dbset as it is in the repository , but without 
any kind of validation logic
Prove: the validation logic or any kind of calculations , any kind of decision
making before implementation of something -->Business Logic

so -->repo blindly implements the db interaction wwithout checking anything
