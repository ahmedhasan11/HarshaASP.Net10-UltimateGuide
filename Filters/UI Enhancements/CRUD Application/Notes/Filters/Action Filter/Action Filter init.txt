(*)Action Filter -->2 methods one executes BEFORE , and the other is AFTER

BEFORE--> OnActionExecuting()             AFTER--> OnActionExecuted()

Benefit??
{
you can access the parameters of action method and validate them
}
FLOW
{
	as soon as the route action is selected, before execution of that particular action method

	-->the OnActionExecuting() executes ,,,, then after the action method executes
	-->the OnActionExecuted() executes
}

Code
{
1-do a new class 
2-inherit it form IActionFilter interface
3-implement this interface , write the code for both methods
4-attach this filter to the particular action method ,
   above your action method do this --> [TypeFilter(typeof(PersonsListActionFilter))]
}

Controller Code Explaination
{
[TypeFilter(typeof(PersonsListActionFilter))]-->do a obj of this class and this will be attached to ActionMethod
}
