(*)its recommended to create all entity classes as a separate class library

(Section){

		(*)your Domain Model (like Country ) , the presentation layer(Controllers,Views,API's) should never access it directly,
			instead-->the presentation layer workswith DTO's & ViewModels-->thenService layer maps those to Domain model

		(*)You won’t make the controller accept a Country object as a method parameter,
			and you won’t make it return a Country object to the client

}
