builder.Services.AddApiVersioning();

//you have to configure the version reader inside this service

so-->

builder.Services.AddApiVersioning(config=>
{
config.ApiVersionReader= new UrlSegmentApiVersionReader(); 
-->required in order to let Asp.Net core to read the version number from this route parameter
});
-->enables asp.net core to identify
the current working version of the API as per the request Url
-->this means it expects the API version number to be included as part of the URL
-->it means as apart of the Route of ApiControllers

-->weare expecting ittobelike this [Route("api/v1/[controller]")]

-->of course version can be different , sonow v: fixed   number:dynamic
-->for this we havea route parameter called version , andwe have toapply to it
a route constraint called apiVersion-->predefined route constraint provided by 
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning

so now --> [Route("api/v{version:apiVersion}/[controller]")]

-->then go through your controllers and add [ApiVersion("1.0")] or whatever number you need
-->you can also add it to a specific action method its ok
