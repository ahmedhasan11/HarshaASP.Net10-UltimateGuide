//now you need to generate a secret key

1-create a new object of SymmetricSecurityKey 
2-in its parameters get the "Key" from appsettings.json
3-then youhave to convert this key into byte array -->Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_configuration["Key"]);

//then we have to assign the algorithm we wanttouse
1-create obj of Signing Credentials
2-pass in its parameter the (security Key, nameof the algo we want to use)
-->(securityKeyObject, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256)

//then we have to make a token generator -->create token based on all these informations
we did

1-create obj of JwtSecurityToken 
2- in its parameters (Issuer, Audience,expiration, arrayofclaims, signingCredentialsOBJ)


1-create anobjectof it
2-use this obj and call its internalmethod-->tokenhandler.WriteToken(JwtSecurityTokenOBJ)
3-tokenhandler.WriteToken(JwtSecurityTokenOBJ)-->this is the Token , take it as string


//now you can return new AuthenticationResponse(the dto you made for  the jwt response)
//thenyoucan supply  to it the Token, Email, Personname, expiration
