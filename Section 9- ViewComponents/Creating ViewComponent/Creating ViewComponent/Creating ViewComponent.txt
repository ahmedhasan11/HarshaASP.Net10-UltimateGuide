how view component works?

1-you make a class which have a suffix of ViewComponent like
Controller classes


2-you inherit that class from the ViewComponents class

3- you should make a method inside that class called-->InvokeAsync

4- why we made that method? because when you invoke the viewcomponent
in any view you have , it automatically creates an object of that class
, then calls the InvokeAsync method

5-inside this method you should return the partial view

6-the partial views of the ViewComponent is not the same as the regular
partial views , so we separate them by that the partial views of 
the ViewComponent we put it in that path
Views/Shared/Components/name_of_ViewComponentClass/viewname.cshtml
---> name_of_ViewComponentClass-->this should be without the suffix
--->also should be the actual name of the viewcomponent not any name

//by default you should make the view name is Default.cshtml
//-->but what if you used another name?
//it will not be recongized , so you should pass the name to the return View("viewName");
