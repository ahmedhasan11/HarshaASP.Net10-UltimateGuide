JWT: token system thatis exchanged betweenthe serverandclient

Flow:
1-user signs in with username& password

2-server generates a token autmoatically for the same,this token includes user details

3-this token will be sent back to the client 

4-we will store this token in the browser

5- for all the subsequent requests 
the browser responsible of claiming that the user is already logged in
-->in order to do that 
---->browser automatically adds the JWT token as a part of the request header

6-this particaulr token will be verified by the server
-->identify that token is valid&& check the user details that are part of the token

7-if token is valid-->the approperiate code will be executed on the server
-->and appropriate response will be sent also 

SO,Over all
-->server generates token & send it to the browser
-->and for each request the browser send the token as apart of the request
-->server verify this token 

-->more secure than just store the user id or details in the browser memory
