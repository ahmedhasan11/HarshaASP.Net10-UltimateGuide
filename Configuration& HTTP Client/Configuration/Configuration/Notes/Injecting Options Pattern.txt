we already discussed the options pattern and how to use it 

what if we better do inject it instead of do all of that code

1-go inject the Model in the program.cs 
2-use the builder.Configuration.GetSection("section name") as a service

this returns object but not a model object , this returns a Ioptions<model class> object
