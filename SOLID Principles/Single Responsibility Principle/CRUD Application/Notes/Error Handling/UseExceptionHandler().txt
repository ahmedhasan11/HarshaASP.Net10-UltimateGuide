we use this to show user friendly error message instead of just a plain text

-->there is a predefined middlware that is called built-in exception handler middleware
that is called -->UseExceptionHandler

Custom Exception Handler Middleware-->used for write your own code into serilog 
for example or writing some status codes

Built-in Exception Handler Middleware -->redirecting to a specific route when an
exception occurs 

above the custom exception handler middleware that we did , app.UseExceptionHandler("")
-->inside its parameters you have to write the path of the view that you need
-->and create the view 

(*)how to use the custom ExceptionHandler with the built-in Exception Handler?
-->just in the custom one type throw; at the last of the method
throw;-->the same exception obj wil be rethrown, it extends the existing stacked trace
so the exception that is thrown from your cutsom --> will be caught by the built-in
