asa developer , of course you can write comments for each and everry endpoint inthe swagger UI

so you or another developer or the anuglar or react developer can test it easy,and also look
at comments 

(*)how to add comments -->it's super easy , using XML comments
1-make xml comment for a specific action method or for all
	
so ,
2-convert this XML documentation comments into an XML file within the same project
	(*)how????
	-->build->output->XML documentation file path and write the name of the file , ex: api.xml
	so this will generate api.xml file in current project when you build

	//and thenthe same comments thatyou made will be contained onthis app.xml file

	//then swagger read this app.xml and each comment inside it

	//and don't worry it will be regenerated every time you build the project 
	//but you have to tell the swagger to read them 
	(*)how? in builder.services.AddSwaggerGen(options=>
	{
	options.IncludeXmlComments(Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory), "api.xml");	
	});
