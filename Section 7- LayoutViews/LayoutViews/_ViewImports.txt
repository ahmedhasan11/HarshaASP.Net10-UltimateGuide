_ViewImport.cshtml -->this view is just used to share the namespaces
like @using namespace.Models etc...

//1-can be in the shared file across all the controllers

//2-or you can make it local inside a specific on ctroller so it will
be used only in the views of this specific controller


//dont make any data or access any data on it bcs thats not for this purpose
