-->of course we said that we are supplying the TypeFilter for that specific action
-->you can pass some arguments from TypeFilter
,,then recieve the same from the Constructor of that Filter class

[TypeFilter(typeof(FilterClassName)), Arguemnts= new object [] {arg1, arg2}]
--> Public FilterClassName (IService service, type param1 , type param2)

-->first parameter recieves arg1 , second parameter recieves arg2


-->funcionality-->it have to add some response header into response


RealBenefit-->you can make this filter to any action method because each time you are supplying
the Key and Value paris dynamically and they gets added to Response Header
