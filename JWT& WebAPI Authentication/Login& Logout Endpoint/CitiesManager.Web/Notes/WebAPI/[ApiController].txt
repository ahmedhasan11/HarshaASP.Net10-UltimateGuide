3-theapi controller must implementattribute called[ApiController] 
-->specifies that these action methods are going to be APi action metohds 
not regular mvc controller actoion methods or endpoints 
so they will not render any view whatever happened

-->also enforeces the controller must to have attribute routing([Route("")])
-->automatically returns bad request result in case any bad request found inthe model state
,,so you dont have to make a condition that if model state
is invalid so return bad request it is auto done using this[ApiController]


(*)its a must that your controller contain attribute routing with [ApiController]


(*)if you didnt use [ApiController] and you want to get some JSON data you have to explicitly mention [FromBody]

(*)in any actionmethod like GetCities()  OR  GetCity() the return type even return cities OR return city  
so a collection or single object all of these will be automatically converted as JSON format that is another benefit provided by
the [ApiController] attribute,,so as a developer you need not convert your data into Json format,,this is done by [ApiController] 
attribute interanlly

(*)as we said-->the [ApiController] make the model validations for us as wesaid , and
creates the same information as an obj of ProblemDetails, thenconvert the sameas JSON,
then this returned as response

inbrief-->internally [ApiController] doesthis
if(ModelState.IsValid==false)
{
return ValidationProblem(ModelState)
}
