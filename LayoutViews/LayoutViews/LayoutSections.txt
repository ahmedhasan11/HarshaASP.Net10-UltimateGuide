you can make a section in your view like this:
@section{
<h1>  this is some test text  </h1>
}

and in the layout view you can make RenderSection("name of section",false)

and the section data that you did will be printed in the specified place you had put the RenderSection in


//in real world projects how we can use these?
1-if you want to add a javascript file for a specific view only , then you can add it to the section you did
and redndersection it
1.1-or you can put that javascript file directly in the layout so all the views will get it

2-adding some hyperlinks
