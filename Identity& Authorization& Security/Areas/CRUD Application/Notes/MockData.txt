//to mock data , firstof all weare using GUID asthe typeofour personID, countryID

//youcan go to tools-->Create Guid--> copy and generate ID's 

//then crate your objects and use the ID's you generated as the IDof the obj(even person or country)

//whatis the problem?
when we go to unit test said that we want  the list of countries or Persons to be empty so we can test
Solution?????--> create a bool and init it with true but-->when you inject the service in the CountryTest
make this bool =false , what this bool do? it mocks data if its true, if its itdoes nothing

-->next estep--> gto mockaroo website and makeeach propertyand eachtype of it -->previewdata and copy it
