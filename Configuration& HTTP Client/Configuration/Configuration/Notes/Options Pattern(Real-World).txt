what if in real world projects you need to just 90%ofthetime access 2 properties or 3 from a specific section in appsettings.json

// hereyouuse options pattern

1-create a new model classand write intoitthe properties you need to access (should be same name like the property in appsettings.json)

2- in code  , using the configuration obj , use the getsection method to access the section in the appsettings.json

3- here yoou have (2) ways
{
 (*)1--> GetSection("section name") .Get<ModelClassName>() --> this creates a new object of the model class , and check
 for the properties names of the model class , if they are matched -->it assign the values to the properties of the obj

 (*)2-->Create a new object of the modelclass , then use the GetSection("section name").Bind(obj_name)



}
